# POLIMI Sports: Sports Booking App for Students

## Project Overview
As part of the Mobile Technologies course, we proposed an app called **POLIMI Sports**, designed to help students and faculty book courts and grounds for various sports activities. While the app was never fully developed, the project outlined how it would be realized using technologies such as React Native, MySQL, and Figma for UI/UX design. The app was presented in a 10-minute pitch supported by a Figma design and detailed business model.

## Key Features
- **Sports Court Booking**: The app allows users to book sports courts and grounds at their convenience.
- **Target Audience**: Primarily aimed at students and faculty of POLIMI (Politecnico di Milano).
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on both Android and iOS, developed using React Native.
  
## Technologies
- **React Native**: For front-end and back-end management.
- **MySQL**: Used for database management and booking records.
- **Figma**: UI/UX design of the app, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- **Google Analytics**: Planned integration to track user engagement and demographic behavior.

## Business Model
- **Service Fee**: A nominal fee of €0.50 is charged for every booking.
- **Partnerships**: Potential collaborations with sports companies like Adidas to offer exclusive promotions and events.
